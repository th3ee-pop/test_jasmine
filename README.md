# jasmine test

In this little project, I try to take my first step using Jasmine to test an app. This app is a simple application for you to choose url from the lists given. A sidebar is given to change the source of these urls. It's a good chance for us to test if the DOM events work as we expected or not. 

## How to use it

You can directly clone this repo and open the index.html in your web browser. You will easily find the test result on the screen.
Or you can check to see this app directly.

## File structure

the "js" folder has the app.js to realize the main app function. But what you have to pay attention to is the "jasmine" folder, which provides the test and spec to see if your app work well. Check feedreader.js in the spec folder to read the code defining the spec logic.
